# distquick
Simple program that takes any data you have copied from a clipboard (say... from a excel file) and plots an interactive graph of the distribution of that data.  Also calculates cp and cpk given specification limits.

if specification limits are unknown, enter 0 or nothing to just get the distribution.

Works best if you bind the program to a shortcut key
